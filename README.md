# Shun's Algebra II Notes

Some of Shun's (Abstract) Algebra II notes during Spring 2025

I plan to upload my biweekly notes for Algebra II during Spring 2025, which will focus more on Ring and Field Theory, including Galois Theory and Commutative Algebra.

I like to take notes by hand using GoodNotes, because I find it most natural and pretty this way. Since it is my own preference, I would not upload a LaTeX file equivalent for my notes, it should be enjoyed as is.

I will only start uploading the week of Feb 17th.
